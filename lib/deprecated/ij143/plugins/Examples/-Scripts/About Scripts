This submenu contains example Javascript scripts that
ImageJ 1.41 and later can run. To run JavaScript, ImageJ
uses the Mozilla Rhino interpreter built into Java 1.6
for Linux and Windows. Mac users, and users of earlier
versions of Java, must download JavaScript.jar into the
plugins folder. This JAR file is available at:

  http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download/tools/JavaScript.jar

To run a script, download it, drag and drop it on the 
"ImageJ" window, then press ctrl-r (Macros>Run Macro).
Or copy it the clipboard, press shift+v (File>New>System Clipboard),
then press ctrl+j (Macros>Evaluate JavaScript).
